I'm a Machine Learning Research Scientist at the Google Deep Mind sister company <a href='https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/'>Isomorphic Labs</a>. We are using machine learning to develop novel drugs for challenging diseases.

Before joining Iso in 2024, I did my PhD in machine learning at the University of Cambridge and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.
Being co-supervised by <a href='https://jmhl.org/'>Prof. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato</a> and <a href='https://is.mpg.de/person/bs'>Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf</a>, I worked on developing generative models for molecular configurations.
My Bachelor's and Master's degree in Physics I obtained in 2017 and 2019 at the Technical University of Munich.

While studying, I completed internships in machine learning research at Microsoft, Amazon, and the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research.
