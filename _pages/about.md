I'm a Machine Learning Research Scientist at <a href='https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/'>Isomorphic Labs</a>. Grown out of Google DeepMind, it is a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google's parent company. We are using machine learning to develop novel drugs for challenging diseases.

Before joining Iso in 2024, I did my PhD in machine learning at the University of Cambridge and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.
Being co-supervised by <a href='https://jmhl.org/'>Prof. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato</a> and <a href='https://is.mpg.de/person/bs'>Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf</a>, I worked on generative models for molecular configurations as well as causal representation learning and computer vision.
I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Physics from the Technical University of Munich in the years 2017 and 2019, respectively.

While studying, I completed internships in machine learning research at Microsoft, Amazon, and the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research.

Besides work, I enjoy endurance sport, especially cycling, running, and hiking.
