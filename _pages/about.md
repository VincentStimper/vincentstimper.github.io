I am a PhD student in the ELLIS program being supervised by Dr. Jose Miguel Hernandez Lobato (University of Cambridge) and Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf (Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems). At the moment, I am working in the Empirical Inference Department of the MPI-IS Tübingen. My Cambridge-Tübingen PhD Fellowship is generously funded by Amazon.

In my research, I'm working on probabilistic modeling and representation learning with a focus on normalizing flows and applications to the physical sciences. My mission is to create theoretically substantiated machine learning algorithms for natural science and engineering applications.
